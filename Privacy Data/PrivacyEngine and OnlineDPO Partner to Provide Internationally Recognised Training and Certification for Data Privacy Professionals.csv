Dublin, Ireland – 12/01/2021: Data protection software and solutions developer PrivacyEngine™ (formerly Sytorus), has added new courses from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) to its extensive training portfolio in 2021. The IAPP training, provided in partnership with OnlineDPO, enables data privacy professionals to attain internationally recognised credentials as information privacy practitioners and managers.
The courses are delivered online or in person, and offer three options of certification for data protection professionals:

Certified Information Privacy Professional/ Europe (CIPP/E), 
Certified Information Privacy Manager (CIPM) 
Certified Information Privacy Technologist (CIPT).

The courses offer data protection professionals all the training needed to plan and implement an effective organisational response to information privacy law. They include in depth coverage of the legal foundations and operational and compliance requirements of the EU GDPR regulation that has influenced data protection practice across the globe.
“Both staff awareness training and professional education are foundational to the delivery of high quality data privacy management. We already offer strong portfolio of training content, delivered in the PrivacyEngine Learning Management System, and we are delighted to be able to add internationally recognised certification programmes such as CIPP, CIPM and CIPT to the portfolio,” said John Ghent, CEO PrivacyEngine.
