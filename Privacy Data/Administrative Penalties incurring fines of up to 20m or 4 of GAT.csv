The underlying message from this list confirms the EU Commission’s main concerns regarding the processing of personal data:* Respect for the rights of the Data Subject, in particular with regard to their Sensitive data* The safe transfer of personal data to destinations outside the EU, and* Respect for the Office of the Supervisory Authority in the jurisdiction in which the Controller is established.
We will continue this series with advice to Controllers and Processors about the appropriate measures to taken in order to avoid committing these offences, and protecting their organisations, both from the financial penalties and the reputational damage that accompanies such an unwelcome event.
