Sytorus has formed a strategic partnership with Casseo, a leading business change and project management consultancy company, to provide a complete end-to-end General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) solution to financial services clients.

The forthcoming GDPR legislation â€“ due to come into force on 25th May, 2018 - represents a significant and complex change management challenge for financial services institutions, with large scale requirements to assess and change a significant number of processes and IT systems to become GDPR compliant. In many cases, the capacity or capability to manage this kind of project may not exist internally.
Designed with larger enterprise banks, SME banks, wealth management companies and other financial institutions in mind, Sytorus and Casseo have combined their expertise to provide a full suite of advisory and onsite GDPR support services, including initial risk assessment, business change strategy, training, ad hoc consultancy in the event of issues arising, constructive managed responses in the event of a breach or incident, software implementation and project delivery.
""Having recognised the scale of the task facing financial services institutions and, realising that few organisations of this kind have the internal resource available to allocate to projects of this size and complexity, we formed a strategic partnership with Casseo to provide a comprehensive end-to-end GDPR solution to clients,"" comments Mike Morrissey, Chief Commercial Officer at Sytorus.
Elizabeth Doyle, Partner at Casseo adds: ""There is a natural synergy between the two companies, with Sytorus providing specialist knowledge and best-practice risk identification and mitigation processes, and Casseo's expertise delivering large scale business change projects. We're excited to partner with Sytorus to support organisations with regard to their Data Protection obligations, easing the workload and pressure on internal teams.""
Sytorus is a recognised leader in pragmatic Data Protection deployment, utilising their proven services and products - including assessments, training and their support platform 'PrivacyEngine' - to help clients ensure that the data they hold is an asset, not a risk. Sytorus is currently working with a number of top financial institutions, which operate in both the UK and Ireland, helping them through their GDPR change management process.
