0,IVI Autumn Summit 2015 and DP-CheckPoint,"

PrivacyEngine is happy to announce its attendance at the IVI Autumn Summit 2015 in Carton House Hotel, in Ireland on the 17th and 18th September.

Sytorus (the company behind PrivacyEngine), can reveal that it was commissioned by IVI (the Innovation Value Institute) to contribute Data Protection expertise and direction as part of a team of senior Data Protection Practitioners and researchers in building a new product which is the first comprehensive critical capability maturity framework for Data Protection anywhere in the world.
The resulting Data Protection Critical Capability is part of IVI’s IT-Capability Maturity Framework (IT-CMF) which has been adopted by some of the largest companies in the world.  
Sytorus are also pleased to be working with IVI in implementing “DP-Checkpoint”, a programme which uses the new framework as a platform for performing a high level assessment service combining a survey with Sytorus expert services.  It will help organisations measure from a scale of 1-5, how effective their organisation is in its compliance with Data Protection, across a comprehensive set of areas.
Not only is this about compliance, but DP-Checkpoint will also help organisations understand how, both commercially and operationally, Data Protection can bring value to the business, and effectively support growth and profitability.
Now that is an exciting breakaway from the traditional approaches to Data Protection, and to be frank, that is exactly what PrivacyEngine is all about as well. Identify reputational risk in your business, related to data management, and put in place effective strategies to mitigate these risks.
Ultimately, those businesses that approach Data Protection in this way will gain measurable benefits in efficiency, effectiveness and productivity.
DP-Checkpoint will formally launch very soon, and we will make sure to post further information about it later next week. We are very excited about it and we believe you will be too.
