Google Self-Driving Technology

For the last couple of years, Google has been working diligently on self-driving technology, and has recently successfully completed testing in the US, and in a limited capacity in Europe.
Google has begun courting car manufacturers to build key partnerships with this technology, but has met with a literal speed bump along the way.
""A car today is a second living room""
In a recent talk in Berlin, Rupert Stadler, the CEO of Audi, one of the leading luxury carmakers in the world, and a German powerhouse in that field, gave his thoughts on this technology, with particular reference to privacy.
""The internet, cookies and other data collectors are almost common courtesy, but a car today is a second living room-- and that's private"", he said, indicating that German manufacturers are concerned about ensuring data protection compliance is maintained if this technology is introduced.
In addition he added, ""Customers want to be at the center of their car ownership and not exploited for it. They want to be in control of their data and not subject to monitoring. And we take this seriously"".
