0,Civil Rights on Privacy,"


The General Data Protection Regulation has become the second most lobbied legislation in the history of the European Union. From public to private sector interests and activist groups on both sides of the privacy debate, nearly everyone has something to say about the upcoming Regulation.Civil rights groups internationally have been continuously vocal in their concerns about the direction the Regulation draft has been heading, with particular focus on ensuring that citizen’s right to privacy is not undermined.

Recently over 60 civil rights groups, representing all corners of the world, including Europe, Africa, the U.S>, Central and South America, wrote to the EU Commission to stop what they claim is an effort to undermine people’s right to privacy.
In the email the civil rights groups claimed that, based on the way things are currently heading, data protection law could become weaker than it is currently.
