Dublin, Ireland – 19/01/2021: Data protection management software leader PrivacyEngine (formerly Sytorus), has teamed-up with US based privacy consulting group Inspire!, to offer outsourced Data Privacy Officer (DPO) services to US-based organisations. The new DPO as a Service (DPOaaS) offering combines authoritative advice from Inspire!’s team of privacy experts with PrivacyEngine’s practical data privacy management platform.  
“Data privacy has moved center stage, as a growing number of US states adopt legislation similar to California’s CCPA and CPRA, and the US Federal Government works to address issues associated with cross-border data transfers. This new reality means organizations large and small need to learn new skills and implement new technology designed to have minimal impact and enhance day-to-day business operations. Compliance with applicable data privacy law is complicated and resource intensive. A proactive approach focused on laying a solid, agile foundation will help businesses flex as the data privacy landscape shifts. This new collaboration between PrivacyEngine and Inspire! is designed to address that demand in a unique way,” said Denise Farnsworth CEO & Founder, Inspire!.
“Bringing together Inspire!’s deep expertise in US and International data privacy law and practice, with PrivacyEngine’s tried and trusted data privacy management platform, we can offer US-based organisations the best in skills and technology to address data privacy compliance issues on a global scale,” said John Ghent, CEO PrivacyEngine.
PrivacyEngine and Inspire!’s DPOaaS provides organisations of all sizes with outsourced access to the latest data privacy skills and technology. It is a flexible service offering, that can be tailored to meet the practical data privacy compliance needs of any organisation including: baseline gap analysis, risk assessment, global privacy program development and implementation, personnel training, data inventory and records of processing activities, privacy and data protection impact assessments, and third-party vendor management.
