Dublin, Ireland – 30/06/2021: Data Protection software and solutions developer PrivacyEngine are delighted to announce that in collaboration with filerskeepers, all PrivacyEngine customers will have instant access to retention information across hundreds of countries and states and hundreds of thousands of legal retention periods.
This vast database of retention obligations will be integrated completely into PrivacyEngine’s Data Privacy Platform through the Records of Processing Activities and search pages. 
By using the technology, you will be able to structure your organisation’s retention policy to be in compliance with global data retention requirements and understand how periods vary between different jurisdictions. 
You will get insights on:

Granular descriptions of what to store
Minimum and maximum storage periods
Dates from when records need to be held
Statutory vs recommended requirements
Links to live legal source requirements
Plain-language legal citations



 “One of the most common questions we are asked is “how long can I hold onto data for?” The problem is organisations face a host of, sometimes conflicting, country and sector-specific rules. We are delighted to be able to offer our customers access to comprehensive and up to date data retention schedules, when completing their records of processing activities” said John Ghent, CEO PrivacyEngine.
 

“We are excited to be partnering up with PrivacyEngine. The capabilities of using our software on the PrivacyEngine platform, will mean their customers will be able to ensure compliance with many must have records retention periods, including Health and Safety, Human Resources and industry specific retention periods etc” Said Wanne Pemmelaar, CEO and co-founder of filerskeepers
