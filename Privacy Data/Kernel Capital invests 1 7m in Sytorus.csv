0,Kernel Capital invests €1.7m in Sytorus,"

Some great news for us here at Sytorus this week as we have secured €1.7 million in investment from the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital early-and growth-stage funds as part of a bigger multimillion-euro fundraising initiative.


""At Sytorus we believe that data protection practitioners deserve the best tools to do their job. This investment will help us to deliver these tools to data protection leaders across the EU,"" commented our CEO John Ghent.
It has been a summer of good news, as only a couple of months ago John Ghent was named Enterprise Ireland’s high-potential start-up founder of the year, which acknowledges and celebrates the commitment that entrepreneurs and start-ups have made to build world class companies of the future. While we were also recently included in the CIO Applications’ top 10 solution providers for 2018 for our GDPR compliance software PrivacyEngine.

From small beginnings in 2013, when founded by John Ghent, Mike Morrissey and Hugh Jones, we now employ more than 50 people and have more than 300 fee-paying customers worldwide. We have recently opened our new office in Frankfurt, our fourth office across Europe, which follows the opening of our office in Stockholm earlier this year and our London office in 2017.
This funding comes as a massive boost as we continue our rapid growth across Europe and continue to help companies not only achieve GDPR compliance but turn their data protection into a business advantage. “GDPR represents the biggest overhaul of the world’s privacy rules since the birth of the internet. Kernel Capital are delighted to announce details of this significant investment which will drive the business to new frontiers and accelerate their growth into several new markets.” said Orla Rimmington, a partner at the Kernal Capital venture fund.
