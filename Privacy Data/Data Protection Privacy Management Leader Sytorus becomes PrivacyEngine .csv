Dublin, Ireland – 05/01/202: Data protection software and solutions developer Sytorus is changing its company name to PrivacyEngine to align with the company’s product offering, and better reflect it’s data privacy heritage. 
PrivacyEngine develops and markets a leading Data Privacy Platform. Its technology and expertise enables organisations to implement practical data protection programmes, and demonstrate compliance with rapidly changing data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA and HIPPA. 
“Both names – Sytorus and PrivacyEngine – have been around since the company was founded in 2013, with the company Sytorus delivering expertise and advice, with data privacy implementation based on our PrivacyEngine platform,” said Dr John Ghent, CEO, PrivacyEngine. “But there has always been a strong feeling that the PrivacyEngine name better reflects what we do, so it makes perfect sense for us to rename our company as we kick-off in 2021.”
What will change?
Our website and email addresses will move to privacyengine.io, but in terms of the service clients receive from us, nothing will change. Our customers will still have the same access to PrivacyEngine, the practical data privacy management platform of choice for organisations, large and small, and our team of experienced data protection experts.
