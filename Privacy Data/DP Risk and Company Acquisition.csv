0,DP Risk and Company Acquisition,"

When acquiring a new company it is important to very quickly get an understanding of what risk you are taking on from a DP perspective. While the ideal scenario would be to complete a full assessment, very often there is a need to issue a couple of question to understand at a very high level what the DP practices are in the target company. Below is a list of sample questions that we would recommend. Some of these questions are taken from the ODPC self-assessment Checklist.

Can you describe your data-collection practices as open, transparent and up-front?
Are you clear about the purpose (or purposes) for which you are keeping personal information?
Are the individuals on your database also clear about this purpose?

Do we regularly purge our databases of data which you no longer need, such as data relating to former customers or staff members?
Are there clear procedures in place for dealing with SAR requests?
What countries do you currently transfer personal data to? For example, if you use Gmail, personal data will be stored in the US. This counts as a transfer. Think of any services or cloud based products you use for email, marketing or storage and where these are located?
