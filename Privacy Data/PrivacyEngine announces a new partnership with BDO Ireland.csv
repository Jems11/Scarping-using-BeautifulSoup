PrivacyEngine provides a globally leading solution for Privacy Management through our Data Privacy Platform and BDO offer best in class consultancy and services to their clients and we are a natural fit together that combined allows us to help more companies manage privacy in an effective and efficient way.  More privacy legislation was passed in 2018** than in the previous century and companies are struggling to understand the nuances and complexities of privacy management, PrivacyEngine with BDO can help reduce this complexity into simple but effective solutions to these challenges.”
Speaking about the partnership, Aidan McHugh, Partner, BDO said:
 
“We are continually striving to help organisations and our clients to solve issues that may arise in an efficient and effective manner. Working with PrivacyEngine and their Data Privacy Platform will greatly help companies when it comes to their data protection requirements, as it provides companies with a centralised technology platform which enables companies to save time and money. The platform will remove the cumbersome need to input data into various spreadsheets, as data will be stored centrally. Many companies are already compliant but for those who are not, I believe that BDO, in conjunction with PrivacyEngine, is perfectly placed to assist companies manage all aspects of data protection programs.”
 
**More than 60 jurisdictions around the world have enacted or proposed postmodern privacy and data protection laws, following the introduction of the GDPR in 2018 and by 2023, 65% of the world’s population will have its personal information covered under modern privacy regulations, up from 10% today.
